# Getting Started: The Basics Without Intimidation

ENPF uses hashtags (#) as simple markers to organize your requests. Don't worry about getting it "right" â€” there's no syntax to break, just helpful guideposts.

Here's the simplest way to start:

```md
I need help with a marketing email.

#APPROACH: Friendly and conversational
I want to sound approachable but professional.

#STRUCTURE:
1. Brief introduction
2. Announcement of our new product
3. How it helps the customer
4. Call to action

Can you draft this for my software company's new project management tool?
```

That's it! You've just used ENPF. The hashtags simply help organize your thinking and make your request clearer.
