### 1. Get More Precise Responses

Instead of hoping the AI understands what you want, ENPF lets you clearly mark what's important.

### 2. Structure Complex Requests

When you need multiple things or have a complex request, ENPF helps break it down so nothing gets missed.

### 3. Control the Tone and Approach

Want the AI to think like an expert in a specific field? ENPF makes this easy to specify.

### 4. Create Consistent Results

By using the same markers each time, you can develop a reliable way to get consistent outcomes.

### 5. Save Time and Frustration

Clear communication from the start means fewer back-and-forth corrections.
